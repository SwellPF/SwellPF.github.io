<p>Paul has been fascinated by computers since he was a child.  His parents bought him a Radio Shack TRS-80 Model II when he was 12.  He learned BASIC from the manual that came with his computer.  A fan of arcade games, Paul wrote his own version of Space Invaders on his Model II so he wouldn't have to spend his allowance at the arcade.  He has taught commercial software to professionals and worked for nearly two decades in the legal space managing a leading firm's online learning initiatives.</p>
