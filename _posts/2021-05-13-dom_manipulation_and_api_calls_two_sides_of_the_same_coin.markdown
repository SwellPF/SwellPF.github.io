For the JavaScript project.... I wrote an entire blog post and then lost it by accidentally hitting the back button on my browser.  Two hours of writing GONE!!!!

I want to throw my laptop into the ocean.

Isn't this more than 250 characters by now?   I just want to get something posted so I can keep writing --- IN MICROSOFT WORD THIS TIME SO I DON'T ACCIDENTALLY ERASE ALL OF MY WORK!!!!!
