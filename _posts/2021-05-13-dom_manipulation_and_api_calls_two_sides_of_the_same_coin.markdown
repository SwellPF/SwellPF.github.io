For the JavaScript project.... I wrote an entire blog post and then lost it by accidentally hitting the back button on my browser.  Two hours of writing GONE!!!!

I want to throw my laptop into the ocean.

A warning to others:  DO NOT write your blog post directly in the Blog Dashboard because if you accidentally navigate away from the page you will lose everything you have written.   Back to the drawing board.
