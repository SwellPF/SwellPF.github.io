*(and the “Return Value” of revisiting your code)*


I started working on my Ruby CLI Data Gem project just before the Christmas holiday.  My project is an app that scrapes team roster information for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers NFL football team website and presents that information to the user.  

As the John Lennon song goes, “life is what happens when you’re busy making other plans” and I had to step away from my studies for several weeks to care for my mother after major surgery.   Even though my project was nearly completed before I stepped away, because so much time had passed I felt the need to review the Ruby course modules again before putting the finishing touches on my code and submitting it for review.   While time consuming, it was a very worthwhile endeavor.  

Re-reading the material again reinforced some of the concepts that I felt a little unsure about the first time around and provided insight to things that weren’t obvious the first time around.  Almost like when you use Google Maps to navigate to an unfamiliar destination you are so focused on the turn-by-turn directions but on subsequent trips you notice more of the scenery and landmarks.

As I was putting the finishing touches on my app I discovered that there had been some minor changes to the website I was scraping requiring modification to my code in order to scrape the data properly.  (Just the kind of thing that happens in the real world!)  While scraping can be tricky and a bit frustrating it gave me a real boost of confidence when I was able to get my app working again within a few minutes. 

Feeling inspired, I even took the time to make some additional improvements to my app during my final review before submission.  What initially felt like a frustrating delay turned out to be an opportunity to gain a more solid understanding of Ruby and a chance to put my nascent programming skills to the test.  The takeaway is to be persistent, keep working at it and don’t be afraid to look back.  And always take a moment to appreciate how far you’ve come.
