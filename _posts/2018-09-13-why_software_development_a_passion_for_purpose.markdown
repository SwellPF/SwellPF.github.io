My love of computers started early.  I got my first computer at age 12 - a Radio Shack TRS-80 Model I with a cassette tape drive and 16K of RAM.  (I feel old when I consider that neither cassette tapes nor Radio Shack exist anymore.)  I sat down with the manual that came with the computer and taught myself BASIC.  When I built my own version of "Space Invaders" and started having my friends over to play it (instead of spending our allowance at the arcade) I knew I was hooked.  Computers have been an integral part of my life ever since.

While I was in college studying a pre-med curriculum I worked in a blood bank lab.  It didn't take long for me to figure out I wasn't cut out for medicine so I changed majors but continued to work in the lab.  As I approached graduation there was an opening at the blood bank in their data processing department as a programmer.  Since I was already familiar with many of the computer programs used at the lab - albeit from a user's perspective - I applied for and landed the job writing new programs and updating existing ones.  As a non-profit the pay was low but I felt a strong sense of purpose when I thought about how my code was being used to track test results to ensure that blood was safe for patients, track blood inventory and shipments to local hospitals. 

Later in my career, I worked for an IT consulting firm which placed contract IT professionals with companies who needed additional assistance with tech-related projects.  I worked in their training and development department which had four trainers (all based in Boston) who had to provide training and support to employees in more than a dozen offices throughout the country.  I spearheaded the effort to implement a web conferencing solution to allow my company to train its employees remotely.  

When the IT bubble burst in 2000, the IT consulting firm struggled and it became necessary for me to move on.  Remarkably, at the same time, a large national law firm was looking for someone based in Tampa, Florida (where I lived) who could bring the necessary experience and expertise to design and implement their vision of an online learning platform.  I worked at that firm for nearly 18 years.  It was exciting to implement the technology to deliver live webinars and on-demand content to our partners and clients.  As technology evolved and improved, our programming became more sophisticated including live streaming HD video in our webinars.  Over time, however, I began to feel restless and  that challenges were increasingly few and far between.  I was no longer seeing my work as that of an architect but as more of a building superintendant.  After more than two years of introspection I decided I wanted to return to doing something that always made me happy: writing code.

So why the extended biography?  It illustrates the fundamental reasons that I decided to pursue software development in the renaissance of my career:  the joy of creative expression, the excitement of continuous learning (which is imperative for those who work in technology) and the satisfaction of building something that has purpose and that people find useful.  

The young kid who built computer games for the enjoyment of his friends grew up to write code for a non-profit health organization and then built an online learning platform to attract, train and retain the best lawyers is ready to be an architect again.
