The Finns have a term that describes and characterizes their culture: **Sisu**.
It is a term that, much like the word “happy,” is defined mostly by other words used to describe it.  Fundamentally, sisu means tenacity, determination, grit, “stick-to-it-iveness” or colloquially simply “guts.”  Facing challenges and adversity and overcoming them.

My journey at Flatiron School has not been the linear path that I expected when I started over two years ago.  The sudden and tragic death of my younger sister a little more than a year earlier had caused me to reflect on the fragility of life and that none of us knows with certainty what the future holds.

At the time, I held a job that paid well but also highly stressful.  I performed my duties well and was respected by my colleagues and clients.  But after nearly two decades there I was at a crossroads.  The fire no longer burned within me.  There were fewer professional challenges or opportunities to learn, explore and create and little to inspire me even as the quantity of work continued to increase.  I was experiencing a combination of burnout and professional frustration.  I was beginning to wonder whether comfort was starting to become complacency.  I asked myself the question: “Is this what you want to do until you are ready to retire?”

There were many times over the last two years of study when I was mentally exhausted or not in the right frame of mind to effectively concentrate on my studies.  In addition to dealing with the anxiety that many of us felt brought on by the COVID pandemic, I grieved the deaths of both of my parents-in-law.  I assisted my mother, who lives alone, after she suffered complications from knee replacement surgery.  One of my siblings with two young children lost their job suddenly as a result of the pandemic and had to sell their home. I helped them move into our house temporarily while they determined their next steps. I had sinus surgery after a series of debilitating sinus infections.

My mother frequently reminds me that I have sisu.  She knows she doesn’t need to, of course.  It’s something I am keenly aware of.  That’s not to say there weren’t moments of self-doubt along my Flatiron journey: “Am I too old to be doing this?” “Wouldn’t I have been more comfortable staying in the job I had?” “Couldn’t I just pursue a job that utilized the skills I already had?”  But I was determined to finish what I started.  Learning to code is hard.  Doing so while facing adversity is even more difficult.  I came to appreciate more than ever the importance of celebrating successes no matter how small.  Appreciating that as I progressed, I was ever closer to the end than I was to the beginning.  Learning that even a small amount of progress is still progress.  And now, here I am.  I will complete my certification this week.  Persevering and overcoming make the success and sense of accomplishment of this moment even more sweet.  

I was reminded of President Kennedy’s speech declaring that the United States would be the first to put a man on the moon.  It would be difficult and there would be setbacks.  But we do hard things because the rewards of earnest struggle are great.  I look forward with great excitement for the future.

> “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things (accomplishments and aspirations), not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.” – President John F. Kennedy at Rice University, September 12, 1962


*Note: I appreciate that these blog entries are generally intended to be technical in nature and I appreciate Flatiron’s forbearance in letting me share the more personal side of my journey.  Future blog posts will be more technology-related.*
